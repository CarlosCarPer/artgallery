# ArtGallery
A hibernate course project of an art webpage

I'm not an artist (if you don't consider programmation as an art), but I like art. I see there's no an official artist webpage. Some artists use Twitter or Instagram to share their works and advertise their commissions pages, prices and patreon. The ancient DeviantArt or Tumblr are other good examples.

So I thought, how about to make a unified platform? So here it is.

## State of the Art

We now have a simple BBDD on postgresql and it's hibernate implementation thanks to Spring Tool Suite.

## Objectives

1. Make a good frontend with Angular
2. Let people register
3. Let people upload pics
4. Let people synchronise their accounts like Twitter and Instagram to works with their respective APIs

With all this done and with the help of the APIs, a registered user could, firstly, upload their already uploaded works to other sites and, secondly, upload a new work to all their synchronized accounts, just by having them uploaded to a site with one click.
